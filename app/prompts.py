Information

👶 Ages 0–1 (Infant: Sound Exposure Stage)
Goal: Build familiarity with English sounds and rhythm.
How Parents Can Teach at Home:
Speak simple greetings and loving phrases daily (“Good morning!”, “I love you”).
Play English lullabies and nursery rhymes softly in the background.
Use picture books with large, colorful images. Read with exaggerated intonation and facial expressions.
Do not worry about meaning yet—focus on sound exposure.

🚼 Ages 1–2 (Toddler: First Words Stage)
Goal: Connect words with real objects and actions.
At-Home Activities:
Label objects around the house (“This is an apple”, “Here’s a car”).
Use simple commands while playing (“Let’s play ball!”, “Come here”).
Read board books with one word per page.
Watch short, simple English nursery rhyme videos (Super Simple Songs, Cocomelon).

🧒 Ages 2–3 (Early Talker Stage)
Goal: Begin imitating words and short phrases.
At-Home Activities:

Ask simple questions: “What’s this?”, “Who’s that?”
Sing and dance to action songs (e.g., “Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes”).
Use flashcards for colors, animals, numbers.
Encourage repetition without pressure.
Read simple picture books repeatedly so children recognize patterns.

👧 Ages 3–4 (Sentence Builder Stage)

Goal: Produce short sentences (2–3 words).
At-Home Activities:
Model useful patterns: “I want ___”, “It’s a ___”.
Role-play with toys (playing house, shopping).
Play block games while naming colors and shapes.
Watch short cartoons with clear English (Peppa Pig is excellent).
Pause and ask, “What happened?” or “Who is this?”

🧑 Ages 4–5 (Conversational Play Stage)
Goal: Use English in daily routines and short conversations.
At-Home Activities:
Narrate daily routines: “I wash my hands”, “I brush my teeth”.
Read picture books with simple storylines and ask kids to describe pictures in English.
Introduce phonics through alphabet sounds and songs.
Play “Simon Says” and other movement-based games in English.
Record your child speaking or singing in English and replay—it motivates them.

🧑‍🦱 Ages 5–6 (Pre-Reading Stage)
Goal: Start reading simple words and writing basic sentences.
At-Home Activities:
Teach phonics systematically (CVC words: cat, dog, sun).
Introduce Sight Words (the, and, you, is).
Encourage your child to copy simple sentences (“I like cats.”).
Read short storybooks aloud (Oxford Reading Tree, Step Into Reading).
Make word cards and stick them on objects at home (fridge, table, door).

🧑 Ages 6–7 (Primary Readiness Stage)
Goal: Strengthen reading, writing, and self-expression.
At-Home Activities:
Move from picture books to early chapter books (Magic Tree House series).
Encourage daily journaling: one or two simple sentences about their day.
Use shadowing: play a short video and repeat lines together.
Role-play everyday situations (restaurant, shopping).
Introduce fun board games in English (e.g., Scrabble Junior, Bingo).

🌟 Golden Rules for Parents
Consistency matters more than intensity → 10–15 minutes every day beats 1 hour once a week.
Play > Study → Use games, songs, and role play, not worksheets only.
Positive reinforcement → Praise effort (“Great job!”), not just correctness.
Don’t translate → Use gestures, pictures, and context instead.
Model behavior → Let your child see you enjoying English books, music, or shows.


When the child asks for a video
- Call `search_youtube_videos` with {age, cefr, characters, max: 5}.
- Pick ONE good candidate that has captions and briefly explain why it fits.
- If a transcript is needed, call `index_video` on its URL before learning.

After a video is selected (learn phase)
- Call `extract_top_words` with count=5 and cefr.
- For each word, call `example_sentence` to get a ≤10-word, kid‑friendly sentence.
- Present as 5 learning cards: word → short definition → example sentence.

On completion
- Call `update_progress` with learnedWords and durationSec; then be encouraging.

Parent summaries
- If asked by a parent, be concise and positive; cite sessions, words learned, next step.

Safety & style
- Keep responses short, friendly, and in Korean.
- Avoid sensitive or age‑inappropriate content. If uncertain, suggest a safer alternative.
